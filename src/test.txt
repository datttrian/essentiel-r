"155" "To Sherlock Holmes she is always _the_ woman. I have seldom heard"
"156" "him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and"
"157" "predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion"
"158" "akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,"
"159" "were abhorrent to his cold, precise, but admirably balanced mind. He"
"160" "was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that"
"161" "the world has seen; but, as a lover, he would have placed himself in a"
"162" "false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe"
"163" "and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent"
"164" "for drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the"
"165" "trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and"
"166" "finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which"
"167" "might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive"
"168" "instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not"
"169" "be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And"
"170" "yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene"
"171" "Adler, of dubious and questionable memory."
"172" ""
"173" "I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away"
"174" "from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred"
"175" "interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master"
"176" "of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention;"
"177" "while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole"
"178" "Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among"
"179" "his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and"
"180" "ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his"
"181" "own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study"
"182" "of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers"
"183" "of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those"
"184" "mysteries, which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police."
"185" "From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his"
"186" "summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing"
"187" "up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee,"
"188" "and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and"
"189" "successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of"
"190" "his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of"
"191" "the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion."
"192" ""
"193" "One night—it was on the 20th of March, 1888—I was returning from a"
"194" "journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when"
"195" "my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered"
"196" "door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and"
"197" "with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a"
"198" "keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his"
"199" "extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I"
"200" "looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette"
"201" "against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his"
"202" "head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who"
"203" "knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own"
"204" "story. He was at work again. He had arisen out of his drug-created"
"205" "dreams, and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the"
"206" "bell, and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part"
"207" "my own."
"208" ""
"209" "His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,"
"210" "to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved"
"211" "me to an arm-chair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a"
"212" "spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the"
"213" "fire, and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion."
"214" ""
"215" "“Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you have put"
"216" "on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.”"
"217" ""
"218" "“Seven!” I answered."
"219" ""
"220" "“Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I"
"221" "fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me"
"222" "that you intended to go into harness.”"
"223" ""
"224" "“Then, how do you know?”"
"225" ""
"226" "“I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting"
"227" "yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless"
"228" "servant girl?”"
"229" ""
"230" "“My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would certainly have"
"231" "been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had"
"232" "a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess; but, as I"
"233" "have changed my clothes, I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary"
"234" "Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice; but there,"
"235" "again, I fail to see how you work it out.”"
"236" ""
"237" "He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together."
"238" ""
"239" "“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the"
"240" "inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the"
"241" "leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have"
"242" "been caused by some one who has very carelessly scraped round the"
"243" "edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you"
"244" "see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and"
"245" "that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the"
"246" "London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms"
"247" "smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his"
"248" "right forefinger, and a bulge on the side of his top-hat to show where"
"249" "he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not"
"250" "pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.”"
"251" ""
"252" "I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his"
"253" "process of deduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked,"
"254" "“the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I"
"255" "could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your"
"256" "reasoning I am baffled, until you explain your process. And yet I"
"257" "believe that my eyes are as good as yours.”"
"258" ""
"259" "“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself"
"260" "down into an arm-chair. “You see, but you do not observe. The"
"261" "distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps"
"262" "which lead up from the hall to this room.”"
"263" ""
"264" "“Frequently.”"
"265" ""
"266" "“How often?”"
"267" ""
"268" "“Well, some hundreds of times.”"
"269" ""
"270" "“Then how many are there?”"
"271" ""
"272" "“How many? I don’t know.”"
"273" ""
"274" "“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just"
"275" "my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have"
"276" "both seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are interested in these"
"277" "little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two"
"278" "of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.” He threw"
"279" "over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open"
"280" "upon the table. “It came by the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”"
"281" ""
"282" "The note was undated, and without either signature or address."
"283" ""
"284" "“There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,”"
"285" "it said, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the"
"286" "very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses"
"287" "of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with"
"288" "matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated."
"289" "This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your"
"290" "chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor"
"291" "wear a mask.”"
"292" ""
"293" "“This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine that it"
"294" "means?”"
"295" ""
"296" "“I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has"
"297" "data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of"
"298" "theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from"
"299" "it?”"
"300" ""
"301" "I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was"
"302" "written."
"303" ""
"304" "“The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked,"
"305" "endeavoring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper could not"
"306" "be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and"
"307" "stiff.”"
"308" ""
"309" "“Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is not an English"
"310" "paper at all. Hold it up to the light.”"
"311" ""
"312" "I did so, and saw a large _E_ with a small _g_, a _P_, and a large _G_"
"313" "with a small _t_ woven into the texture of the paper."
"314" ""
"315" "“What do you make of that?” asked Holmes."
"316" ""
"317" "“The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”"
"318" ""
"319" "“Not at all. The _G_ with the small _t_ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’"
"320" "which is the German for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like"
"321" "our ‘Co.’ _P_, of course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the _Eg_. Let us"
"322" "glance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume"
"323" "from his shelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a"
"324" "German-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ‘Remarkable"
"325" "as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous"
"326" "glass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of"
"327" "that?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud"
"328" "from his cigarette."
"329" ""
"330" "“The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said."
"331" ""
"332" "“Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the"
"333" "peculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have"
"334" "from all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have"
"335" "written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It"
"336" "only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German"
"337" "who writes upon Bohemian paper, and prefers wearing a mask to showing"
"338" "his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our"
"339" "doubts.”"
"340" ""
"341" "As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating"
"342" "wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes"
"343" "whistled."
"344" ""
"345" "“A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he continued, glancing out of"
"346" "the window. “A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred"
"347" "and fifty guineas apiece. There’s money in this case, Watson, if there"
"348" "is nothing else.”"
"349" ""
"350" "“I think that I had better go, Holmes.”"
"351" ""
"352" "“Not a bit, doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell."
"353" "And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.”"
"354" ""
"355" "“But your client—”"
"356" ""
"357" "“Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes."
"358" "Sit down in that arm-chair, doctor, and give us your best attention.”"
"359" ""
"360" "A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the"
"361" "passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and"
"362" "authoritative tap."
"363" ""
"364" "“Come in!” said Holmes."
"365" ""
"366" "[Illustration: “A MAN ENTERED”]"
"367" ""
"368" "A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches"
"369" "in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich"
"370" "with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad"
"371" "taste. Heavy bands of Astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and"
"372" "fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which"
"373" "was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-colored silk, and"
"374" "secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming"
"375" "beryl. Boots which extended half-way up his calves, and which were"
"376" "trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of"
"377" "barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He"
"378" "carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper"
"379" "part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard"
"380" "mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand"
"381" "was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face"
"382" "he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging"
"383" "lip, and a long, straight chin, suggestive of resolution pushed to the"
"384" "length of obstinacy."
"385" ""
"386" "“You had my note?” he asked, with a deep harsh voice and a strongly"
"387" "marked German accent. “I told you that I would call.” He looked from"
"388" "one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address."
"389" ""
"390" "“Pray take a seat,” said Holmes. “This is my friend and colleague, Dr."
"391" "Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom"
"392" "have I the honor to address?”"
"393" ""
"394" "“You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman."
"395" "I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honor"
"396" "and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme"
"397" "importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.”"
"398" ""
"399" "I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into"
"400" "my chair. “It is both, or none,” said he. “You may say before this"
"401" "gentleman anything which you may say to me.”"
"402" ""
"403" "The count shrugged his broad shoulders. “Then I must begin,” said he,"
"404" "“by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years, at the end of"
"405" "that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too"
"406" "much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon"
"407" "European history.”"
"408" ""
"409" "“I promise,” said Holmes."
"410" ""
"411" "“And I.”"
"412" ""
"413" "“You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor. “The august"
"414" "person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may"
"415" "confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is"
"416" "not exactly my own.”"
"417" ""
"418" "“I was aware of it,” said Holmes, dryly."
"419" ""
"420" "“The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has"
"421" "to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and"
"422" "seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak"
"423" "plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary"
"424" "kings of Bohemia.”"
"425" ""
"426" "“I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes, settling himself down in"
"427" "his arm-chair and closing his eyes."
"428" ""
"429" "Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,"
"430" "lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as"
"431" "the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes"
"432" "slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client."

"462" "all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult"
"463" "to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish"
"464" "information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between"

"470" "Warsaw—Yes! Retired from operatic stage—ha! Living in London—quite"
"471" "so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young"

"620" "At three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not"
"621" "yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house"
"622" "shortly after eight o’clock in the morning. I sat down beside the"
"623" "fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he"
"624" "might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though"
"625" "it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which"
"626" "were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded,"
"627" "still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client"
"628" "gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the"
"629" "investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his"
"630" "masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which"
"631" "made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the"
"632" "quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable"
"633" "mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very"
"634" "possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head."
"635" ""
"636" "It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking"
"637" "groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and"
"638" "disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to"
"639" "my friend’s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look"
"640" "three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod"
"641" "he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes"
"642" "tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his"
"643" "pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire, and laughed"
"644" "heartily for some minutes."
"645" ""
"646" "“Well, really!” he cried, and then he choked; and laughed again until"
"647" "he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair."
"648" ""
"649" "“What is it?”"
"650" ""
"651" "“It’s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed"
"652" "my morning, or what I ended by doing.”"
"653" ""
"654" "“I can’t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and"
"655" "perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.”"
"656" ""
"657" "“Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however."
"658" "I left the house a little after eight o’clock this morning, in the"
"659" "character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and"
"660" "freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all"
"661" "that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a _bijou_"
"662" "villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to"
"663" "the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on"
"664" "the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor,"
"665" "and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could"
"666" "open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window"
"667" "could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it"
"668" "and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting"
"669" "anything else of interest."
"670" ""
"671" "“I then lounged down the street, and found, as I expected, that there"
"672" "was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent"
"673" "the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and I received in"
"674" "exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco,"
"675" "and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say"
"676" "nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighborhood in whom I was"
"677" "not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to"
"678" "listen to.”"
"679" ""
"680" "“And what of Irene Adler?” I asked."
"681" ""
"682" "“Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part. She"
"683" "is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the"
"684" "Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives"
"685" "out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom"
"686" "goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male"
"687" "visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing,"
"688" "never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey"
"689" "Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a"
"690" "confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews,"
"691" "and knew all about him. When I had listened to all that they had to"
"692" "tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to"
"693" "think over my plan of campaign."
"694" ""
"695" "“This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the"
"696" "matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation"
"697" "between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she"
"698" "his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had"
"699" "probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter,"
"700" "it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I"
"701" "should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the"
"702" "gentleman’s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it"
"703" "widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these"
"704" "details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are"
"705" "to understand the situation.”"
"706" ""
"707" "“I am following you closely,” I answered."
"708" ""
"709" "“I was still balancing the matter in my mind, when a hansom cab drove"
"710" "up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably"
"711" "handsome man, dark, aquiline, and mustached—evidently the man of whom"
"712" "I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman"
"713" "to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of"
"714" "a man who was thoroughly at home."
"715" ""
"716" "“He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of"
"717" "him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking"
"718" "excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently"
"719" "he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up"
"720" "to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it"
"721" "earnestly. ‘Drive like the devil,’ he shouted, ‘first to Gross &"
"722" "Hankey’s in Regent Street, and then to the church of St. Monica in the"
"723" "Edgware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!’"
"724" ""
"725" "“Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do"
"726" "well to follow them, when up the lane came a neat little landau, the"
"727" "coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear,"
"728" "while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It"
"729" "hadn’t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I"
"730" "only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman,"
"731" "with a face that a man might die for."

"739" "shabby fare; but I jumped in before he could object. ‘The Church of"
"740" "St. Monica,’ said I, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty"
"741" "minutes.’ It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was"
"742" "clear enough what was in the wind."
"743" ""
"744" "“My cabby drove fast. I don’t think I ever drove faster, but the others"
"745" "were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses"
"746" "were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried"
"747" "into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had"
"748" "followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with"
"749" "them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I"
"750" "lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a"
"751" "church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to"
"752" "me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.”"

"762" "vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting"
"763" "in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton,"
"764" "bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman"

"766" "clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position"
"767" "in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of"
"768" "it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been"
"769" "some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely"
"770" "refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky"
"771" "appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the"
"772" "streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I"

"780" "separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. ‘I"

"883" "“You see,” remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the"
"884" "house, “this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes"
"885" "a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse"
"886" "to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming"
"887" "to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find"
"888" "the photograph?”"
"889" ""
"890" "“Where, indeed?”"
"891" ""
"892" "“It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet"
"893" "size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows"
"894" "that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two"
"895" "attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that"
"896" "she does not carry it about with her.”"
"897" ""
"898" "“Where, then?”"
"899" ""
"900" "“Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am"
"901" "inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they"
"902" "like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to any one"
"903" "else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell"
"904" "what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a"
"905" "business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within"
"906" "a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be"
"907" "in her own house.”"

"916" ""
"917" "“What then?”"

"919" "“I will get her to show me.”"
"920" ""
"921" "“But she will refuse.”"

"923" "“She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her"
"924" "carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.”"

"926" "As he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round the"
"927" "curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to"
"928" "the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at"
"929" "the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a"
"930" "copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with"
"931" "the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by"
"932" "the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the"
"933" "scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was"
"934" "struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage,"
"935" "was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who"
"936" "struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes"
"937" "dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached her"
"938" "he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely"
"939" "down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one"
"940" "direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better"
"941" "dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it,"
"942" "crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene"
"943" "Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she"
"944" "stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of"
"945" "the hall, looking back into the street."
"946" ""
"947" "“Is the poor gentleman much hurt?” she asked."
"948" ""
"949" "“He is dead,” cried several voices."

"951" "“No, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another. “But he’ll be gone"
"952" "before you can get him to hospital.”"
"953" ""
"954" "“He’s a brave fellow,” said a woman. “They would have had the lady’s"
"955" "purse and watch if it hadn’t been for him. They were a gang, and a"
"956" "rough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.”"
"957" ""
"958" "“He can’t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?”"
"959" ""
"960" "“Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa."

"962" ""
"963" "Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the"
"964" "principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post"
"965" "by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been"
"966" "drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not"
"967" "know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part"
"968" "he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of"
"969" "myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom"
"970" "I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited"
"971" "upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to"
"972" "Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me."
"973" "I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster."
"974" "After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing"
"975" "her from injuring another."
"976" ""
"977" "Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who"
"978" "is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At"
"979" "the same instant I saw him raise his hand, and at the signal I tossed"
"980" "my rocket into the room with a cry of “Fire!” The word was no sooner"
"981" "out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and"
"982" "ill—gentlemen, ostlers, and servant-maids—joined in a general shriek"
"983" "of “Fire!” Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at"
"984" "the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment"
"985" "later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false"
"986" "alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner"
"987" "of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm"
"988" "in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly"
"989" "and in silence for some few minutes, until we had turned down one of"
"990" "the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgware Road."
"991" ""
"992" "“You did it very nicely, doctor,” he remarked. “Nothing could have been"
"993" "better. It is all right.”"
"994" ""

"996" ""

"1002" ""
"1003" "“I am still in the dark.”"
"1004" ""
"1005" "“I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing. “The matter was"
"1006" "perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that every one in the street was"
"1007" "an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.”"
"1008" ""
"1009" "“I guessed as much.”"
"1010" ""
"1011" "“Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the"
"1012" "palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my"
"1013" "face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.”"
"1014" ""
"1015" "“That also I could fathom.”"
"1016" ""
"1017" "“Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could"
"1018" "she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I"
"1019" "suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined"
"1020" "to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were"
"1021" "compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.”"
"1022" ""
"1023" "“How did that help you?”"
"1024" ""
"1025" "“It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire,"
"1026" "her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It"
"1027" "is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken"
"1028" "advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it"
"1029" "was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married"
"1030" "woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box."
"1031" "Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house"
"1032" "more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to"
"1033" "secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting"
"1034" "were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The"
"1035" "photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right"
"1036" "bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as"
"1037" "she half-drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she"
"1038" "replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have"
"1039" "not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the"
"1040" "house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once;"
"1041" "but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it"
"1042" "seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.”"

"1047" "to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown"
"1048" "into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that"
"1049" "when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be"
"1050" "a satisfaction to His Majesty to regain it with his own hands.”"

"1145" "photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was"
"1146" "superscribed to “Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.” My"

"1907" "his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often"
"1908" "thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which"
"1909" "occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from"

"2471" "afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank"
"2472" "did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would"
"2473" "get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat."
"2474" "But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had"
"2475" "he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all"
"2476" "father’s friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit"
"2477" "to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken"
"2478" "out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off"
"2479" "to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I,"

"2499" ""

"2501" "have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman"
"2502" "should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to"
"2503" "mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got"
"2504" "mine yet.”"
"2505" ""
"2506" "“But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?”"
"2507" ""
"2508" "“Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote"
"2509" "and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until"
"2510" "he had gone. We could write in the mean time, and he used to write"
"2511" "every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need"
"2512" "for father to know.”"

"2519" ""
"2520" "“What office?”"

"2531" ""
"2532" "“Where did you address your letters, then?”"
"2533" ""
"2534" "“To the Leadenhall Street Post-office, to be left till called for. He"
"2535" "said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all"
"2536" "the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to"
"2537" "type-write them, like he did his, but he wouldn’t have that, for he"
"2538" "said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they"
"2539" "were type-written he always felt that the machine had come between us."
"2540" "That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the"
"2541" "little things that he would think of.”"
"2542" ""
"2543" "“It was most suggestive,” said Holmes. “It has long been an axiom of"
"2544" "mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you"
"2545" "remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?”"
"2546" ""
"2547" "“He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in"
"2548" "the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be"
"2549" "conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was"
"2550" "gentle. He’d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he"
"2551" "told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating,"
"2552" "whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and"
"2553" "plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted"
"2554" "glasses against the glare.”"

"2557" "to France?”"
"2558" ""
"2559" "“Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again, and proposed that we should"
"2560" "marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest, and made"
"2561" "me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I"
"2562" "would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me"
"2563" "swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his"
"2564" "favor from the first, and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when"
"2565" "they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father;"
"2566" "but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him"
"2567" "afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I"
"2568" "didn’t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask"
"2569" "his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn’t want"
"2570" "to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the"
"2571" "company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the"
"2572" "very morning of the wedding.”"
"2573" ""
"2574" "“It missed him, then?”"
"2575" ""
"2576" "“Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.”"
"2577" ""
"2578" "“Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the"
"2579" "Friday. Was it to be in church?”"
"2580" ""
"2581" "“Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour’s, near King’s"
"2582" "Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras"
"2583" "Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us, he"
"2584" "put us both into it, and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which"
"2585" "happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church"
"2586" "first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step"
"2587" "out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and"
"2588" "looked, there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not"
"2589" "imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own"
"2590" "eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard"
"2591" "anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.”"
"2592" ""
"2593" "“It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,” said"
"2594" "Holmes."
"2595" ""
"2596" "“Oh no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the"
"2597" "morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true;"
"2598" "and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate"
"2599" "us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he"
"2600" "would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a"
"2601" "wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.”"
"2602" ""
"2603" "“Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some"
"2604" "unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?”"
"2605" ""
"2606" "“Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not"
"2607" "have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.”"
"2608" ""
"2609" "“But you have no notion as to what it could have been?”"
"2610" ""
"2611" "“None.”"
"2612" ""
"2613" "“One more question. How did your mother take the matter?”"
"2614" ""
"2615" "“She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again.”"
"2616" ""
"2617" "“And your father? Did you tell him?”"
"2618" ""
"2619" "“Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and"
"2620" "that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could any"
"2621" "one have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving"
"2622" "me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got"
"2623" "my money settled on him, there might be some reason; but Hosmer was"
"2624" "very independent about money, and never would look at a shilling of"
"2625" "mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write?"
"2626" "Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of! and I can’t sleep a wink at"
"2627" "night.” She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff, and began to"
"2628" "sob heavily into it."
"2629" ""
"2630" "“I shall glance into the case for you,” said Holmes, rising; “and I"
"2631" "have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight"
"2632" "of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon"
"2633" "it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your"

"2674" "old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having"
"2675" "lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths"
"2676" "spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face."

"2678" "“Quite an interesting study, that maiden,” he observed. “I found her"

"2690" "realize the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails,"
"2691" "or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you"
"2692" "gather from that woman’s appearance? Describe it.”"
"2693" ""
"2694" "“Well, she had a slate-colored, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather"
"2695" "of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it,"
"2696" "and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather"
"2697" "darker than coffee color, with a little purple plush at the neck and"
"2698" "sleeves. Her gloves were grayish, and were worn through at the right"
"2699" "forefinger. Her boots I didn’t observe. She had small, round, hanging"
"2700" "gold ear-rings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do, in a"
"2701" "vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.”"

"2703" "Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled."
"2704" ""
"2705" "“’Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have"
"2706" "really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed"
"2707" "everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you"
"2708" "have a quick eye for color. Never trust to general impressions, my boy,"
"2709" "but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a"
"2710" "woman’s sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee"
"2711" "of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves,"
"2712" "which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line"
"2713" "a little above the wrist, where the type-writist presses against the"
"2714" "table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type,"
"2715" "leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it"
"2716" "farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest"
"2717" "part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and observing the dint"
"2718" "of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon"
"2719" "short sight and type-writing, which seemed to surprise her.”"
"2720" ""
"2721" "“It surprised me.”"
"2722" ""
"2723" "“But, surely, it was very obvious. I was then much surprised and"
"2724" "interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she"
"2725" "was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the"
"2726" "one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one."
"2727" "One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the"
"2728" "other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young"
"2729" "lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots,"
"2730" "half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a"
"2731" "hurry.”"

"2737" "but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was"
"2738" "torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove"
"2739" "and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry,"
"2740" "and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the"
"2741" "mark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing,"
"2742" "though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would"

"2925" "positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever"
"2926" "step-father do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head"
"2927" "than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he"
"2928" "disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked"
"2929" "the face with a mustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear"
"2930" "voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the"

"2942" "an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman’s"

"2945" "obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go,"
"2946" "if a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an"

"2949" "forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The"
"2950" "thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a"
"2951" "dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the"
"2952" "young lady’s mind, and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor"

"3230" "not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances"
"3231" "were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own"
"3232" "arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as"
"3233" "highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural"
"3234" "under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy"
"3235" "to a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as"
"3236" "either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint"
"3237" "and firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not"
"3238" "unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his"
"3239" "father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far"
"3240" "forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even,"
"3241" "according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise"
"3242" "his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which"
"3243" "are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy"
"3244" "mind, rather than of a guilty one.”"
"3245" ""
"3246" "I shook my head. “Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,”"
"3247" "I remarked."
"3248" ""
"3249" "“So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.”"
"3250" ""

"3252" ""
"3253" "“It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though"
"3254" "there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find"
"3255" "it here, and may read it for yourself.”"
"3256" ""
"3257" "He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper,"
"3258" "and having turned down the sheet, he pointed out the paragraph in which"
"3259" "the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had"
"3260" "occurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage, and read"
"3261" "it very carefully. It ran in this way:"
"3262" ""
"3263" "“Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called, and"
"3264" "gave evidence as follows: ‘I had been away from home for three days at"
"3265" "Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday,"
"3266" "the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and"
"3267" "I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John"
"3268" "Cobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap"
"3269" "in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk"
"3270" "rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he"
"3271" "was going. I then took my gun, and strolled out in the direction of"
"3272" "the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit-warren"
"3273" "which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the"
"3274" "game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in"
"3275" "thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in"
"3276" "front of me. When about a hundred yards from the Pool I heard a cry of"
"3277" "“Cooee!” which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then"
"3278" "hurried forward, and found him standing by the Pool. He appeared to be"
"3279" "much surprised at seeing me, and asked me rather roughly what I was"
"3280" "doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words, and almost"
"3281" "to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing"
"3282" "that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him, and returned"
"3283" "towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however,"
"3284" "when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back"
"3285" "again. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head"
"3286" "terribly injured. I dropped my gun, and held him in my arms, but he"
"3287" "almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then"
"3288" "made my way to Mr. Turner’s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest,"
"3289" "to ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and"
"3290" "I have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man,"
"3291" "being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners; but he had, as far"
"3292" "as I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.’"

"3337" "that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague"
"3338" "impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the"
"3339" "left of me. It seemed to me to be something gray in color, a coat of"
"3340" "some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked"
"3341" "round for it, but it was gone."

"3365" ""
"3366" "“I see,” said I, as I glanced down the column, “that the coroner in"
"3367" "his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls"
"3368" "attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having"
"3369" "signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details"
"3370" "of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his"
"3371" "father’s dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against"
"3372" "the son.”"

"3374" "Holmes laughed softly to himself, and stretched himself out upon the"
"3375" "cushioned seat. “Both you and the coroner have been at some pains,”"
"3376" "said he, “to single out the very strongest points in the young man’s"
"3377" "favor. Don’t you see that you alternately give him credit for having"
"3378" "too much imagination and too little. Too little, if he could not invent"
"3379" "a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury;"
"3380" "too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything"
"3381" "so _outré_ as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the"
"3382" "vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of"
"3383" "view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither"
"3384" "that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and"
"3385" "not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of"

"3389" "It was nearly four o’clock when we at last, after passing through"
"3390" "the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn,"
"3391" "found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean,"
"3392" "ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the"
"3393" "platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings"
"3394" "which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no"
"3395" "difficulty in recognizing Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove"
"3396" "to the Hereford Arms, where a room had already been engaged for us."

"3415" "of course, one can’t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too."
"3416" "She had heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly"

"3428" "you so. I know that James didn’t do it. I know it, and I want you to"
"3429" "start upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon"
"3430" "that point. We have known each other since we were little children, and"

"3446" "Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. “I am afraid that my colleague has"
"3447" "been a little quick in forming his conclusions,” he said."
"3448" ""
"3449" "“But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And"
"3450" "about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he"

"3452" "it.”"

"3454" "“In what way?” asked Holmes."
"3455" ""
"3456" "“It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many"
"3457" "disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should"
"3458" "be a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as"
"3459" "brother and sister; but of course he is young, and has seen very little"
"3460" "of life yet, and—and—well, he naturally did not wish to do anything"

"3523" "streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I"
"3524" "lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed"
"3525" "novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared"
"3526" "to the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my"
"3527" "attention wander so continually from the fiction to the fact, that I"
"3528" "at last flung it across the room, and gave myself up entirely to a"
"3529" "consideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy"
"3530" "young man’s story was absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what"
"3531" "absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred"
"3532" "between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when,"
"3533" "drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something"
"3534" "terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the"
"3535" "injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell,"
"3536" "and called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim"
"3537" "account of the inquest. In the surgeon’s deposition it was stated that"
"3538" "the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the"
"3539" "occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon."
"3540" "I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been"
"3541" "struck from behind. That was to some extent in favor of the accused,"
"3542" "as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still,"
"3543" "it did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his"
"3544" "back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call"
"3545" "Holmes’s attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference"
"3546" "to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying"
"3547" "from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more"
"3548" "likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could"
"3549" "it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation."
"3550" "And then the incident of the gray cloth, seen by young McCarthy. If"
"3551" "that were true, the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress,"
"3552" "presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood"
"3553" "to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling"
"3554" "with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries"
"3555" "and improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade’s"
"3556" "opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes’s insight that"
"3557" "I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen"
"3558" "his conviction of young McCarthy’s innocence."

"3563" "“The glass still keeps very high,” he remarked, as he sat down. “It is"
"3564" "of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the"

"3592" "of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his"
"3593" "father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss"

"3596" "him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife"
"3597" "that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did"
"3598" "not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has"
"3599" "come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers"
"3600" "that he is in serious trouble, and likely to be hanged, has thrown"
"3601" "him over utterly, and has written to him to say that she has a husband"
"3602" "already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between"

"3611" "was away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that"

"3622" "that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.”"
"3623" ""
"3624" "“An elderly man, I presume?” said Holmes."
"3625" ""
"3626" "“About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life"
"3627" "abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business"
"3628" "has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy’s,"
"3629" "and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he"
"3630" "gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.”"
"3631" ""
"3632" "“Indeed! That is interesting,” said Holmes."
"3633" ""
"3634" "“Oh yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about"
"3635" "here speaks of his kindness to him.”"
"3636" ""
"3637" "“Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this"
"3638" "McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been"
"3639" "under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his"
"3640" "son to Turner’s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate,"
"3641" "and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of"
"3642" "a proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we"
"3643" "know that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us"
"3644" "as much. Do you not deduce something from that?”"
"3645" ""
"3646" "“We have got to the deductions and the inferences,” said Lestrade,"
"3647" "winking at me. “I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without"
"3648" "flying away after theories and fancies.”"

"3654" "get hold of,” replied Lestrade, with some warmth."

"3656" "“And that is—”"
"3657" ""
"3658" "“That McCarthy, senior, met his death from McCarthy, junior, and that"
"3659" "all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.”"
"3660" ""
"3661" "“Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,” said Holmes, laughing."
"3662" "“But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the"
"3663" "left.”"
"3664" ""
"3665" "“Yes, that is it.” It was a wide-spread, comfortable-looking building,"
"3666" "two-storied, slate roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon"
"3667" "the gray walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however,"
"3668" "gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still"
"3669" "lay heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes’s"
"3670" "request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his"
"3671" "death, and also a pair of the son’s, though not the pair which he had"
"3672" "then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight"
"3673" "different points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from"
"3674" "which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool."

"3678" "Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent"
"3679" "as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of"
"3680" "Baker Street would have failed to recognize him. His face flushed and"
"3681" "darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard, black lines, while his"
"3682" "eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was"
"3683" "bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins"
"3684" "stood out like whip-cord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed"
"3685" "to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so"
"3686" "absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him, that a question"
"3687" "or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked"
"3688" "a quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his"
"3689" "way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of"
"3690" "the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all"
"3691" "that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path"
"3692" "and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes"
"3693" "Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a"
"3694" "little _détour_ into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the"
"3695" "detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with"
"3696" "the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his"
"3697" "actions was directed towards a definite end."
"3698" ""
"3699" "The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some"
"3700" "fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley"
"3701" "Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods"
"3702" "which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting"
"3703" "pinnacles which marked the site of the rich land-owner’s dwelling. On"
"3704" "the Hatherley side of the Pool the woods grew very thick, and there was"
"3705" "a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of"
"3706" "the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the"
"3707" "exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was"
"3708" "the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by"
"3709" "the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager"
"3710" "face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the"
"3711" "trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and"
"3712" "then turned upon my companion."
"3713" ""
"3714" "“What did you go into the Pool for?” he asked."
"3715" ""
"3716" "“I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or"
"3717" "other trace. But how on earth—”"
"3718" ""
"3719" "“Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward"
"3720" "twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it"
"3721" "vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I"
"3722" "been here before they came like a herd of buffalo, and wallowed all"
"3723" "over it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they"
"3724" "have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But"
"3725" "here are three separate tracks of the same feet.” He drew out a lens,"
"3726" "and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all"
"3727" "the time rather to himself than to us. “These are young McCarthy’s"
"3728" "feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly so that the soles"
"3729" "are deeply marked, and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his"
"3730" "story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the"
"3731" "father’s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the"
"3732" "butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What"
"3733" "have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They"
"3734" "come, they go, they come again—of course that was for the cloak."
"3735" "Now where did they come from?” He ran up and down, sometimes losing,"
"3736" "sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the"
"3737" "wood, and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the"
"3738" "neighborhood. Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this, and"
"3739" "lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction."
"3740" "For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried"
"3741" "sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope, and"
"3742" "examining with his lens not only the ground, but even the bark of the"
"3743" "tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss,"
"3744" "and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a"
"3745" "pathway through the wood until he came to the high-road, where all"
"3746" "traces were lost."

"3748" "“It has been a case of considerable interest,” he remarked, returning"
"3749" "to his natural manner. “I fancy that this gray house on the right must"
"3750" "be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and"
"3751" "perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our"

"3827" "his father should, according to his account, cry ‘Cooee!’ before seeing"
"3828" "him. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled"
"3829" "several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son’s"
"3830" "ear. Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will"
"3831" "begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.”"
"3832" ""
"3833" "“What of this ‘Cooee!’ then?”"
"3834" ""
"3835" "“Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as"
"3836" "far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within"
"3837" "ear-shot. The ‘Cooee!’ was meant to attract the attention of whoever"
"3838" "it was that he had the appointment with. But ‘Cooee’ is a distinctly"
"3839" "Australian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a"
"3840" "strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him"
"3841" "at Boscombe Pool was some one who had been in Australia.”"
"3842" ""
"3843" "“What of the rat, then?”"

"3863" "considerably. The possession of a gray garment was a third point"
"3864" "which, granting the son’s statement to be correct, was a certainty. We"

"4606" "its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which"
"4607" "led up to it, but also all the results which would follow from it. As"
"4608" "Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of"
"4609" "a single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link"
"4610" "in a series of incidents, should be able to accurately state all the"

"4617" "as you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even"
"4618" "in these days of free education and encyclopædias, is a somewhat rare"
"4619" "accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should"
"4620" "possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work,"
"4621" "and this I have endeavored in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you"
"4622" "on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits"

"4639" "me down the letter K of the American Encyclopædia which stands upon"

"4641" "and see what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start"
"4642" "with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong"
"4643" "reason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all"
"4644" "their habits, and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida"
"4645" "for the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of"
"4646" "solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of some one"
"4647" "or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear"
"4648" "of some one or something which drove him from America. As to what it"
"4649" "was he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable"
"4650" "letters which were received by himself and his successors. Did you"
"4651" "remark the post-marks of those letters?”"
"4652" ""
"4653" "“The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third"
"4654" "from London.”"
"4655" ""
"4656" "“From East London. What do you deduce from that?”"
"4657" ""
"4658" "“They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.”"
"4659" ""
"4660" "“Excellent. We have already a clew. There can be no doubt that the"
"4661" "probability—the strong probability—is that the writer was on board"
"4662" "of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of"
"4663" "Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment,"
"4664" "in Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest"
"4665" "anything?”"
"4666" ""
"4667" "“A greater distance to travel.”"
"4668" ""
"4669" "“But the letter had also a greater distance to come.”"

"4671" "“Then I do not see the point.”"
"4672" ""
"4673" "“There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man"
"4674" "or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always sent their"
"4675" "singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission."
"4676" "You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from"
"4677" "Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would"
"4678" "have arrived almost as soon as their letter. But as a matter of fact"
"4679" "seven weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the"
"4680" "difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter, and the"
"4681" "sailing-vessel which brought the writer.”"
"4682" ""
"4683" "“It is possible.”"
"4684" ""
"4685" "“More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of"
"4686" "this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has"
"4687" "always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to"
"4688" "travel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we"
"4689" "cannot count upon delay.”"
"4690" ""
"4691" "“Good God!” I cried; “what can it mean, this relentless persecution?”"
"4692" ""
"4693" "“The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance"
"4694" "to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite"
"4695" "clear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not"
"4696" "have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner’s"
"4697" "jury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men"
"4698" "of resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the"
"4699" "holder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be"
"4700" "the initials of an individual, and becomes the badge of a society.”"

"4708" ""
"4709" "Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. “Here it"
"4710" "is,” said he, presently, “‘Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the"
"4711" "fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This"
"4712" "terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in"
"4713" "the Southern States after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local"
"4714" "branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee,"
"4715" "Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was used"
"4716" "for political purposes, principally for the terrorizing of the negro"
"4717" "voters, and the murdering and driving from the country of those who"
"4718" "were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by"
"4719" "a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally"
"4720" "recognized shape—a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or"
"4721" "orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim might either openly"
"4722" "abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. If he braved the"
"4723" "matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some"
"4724" "strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organization of the"
"4725" "society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case"
"4726" "upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in"
"4727" "which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. For"
"4728" "some years the organization flourished, in spite of the efforts of the"
"4729" "United States Government and of the better classes of the community in"
"4730" "the South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly"

"4737" "and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the"
"4738" "more implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this"
"4739" "register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South,"

"5763" ""
"5764" "“Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is"
"5765" "as black as a tinker’s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he"
"5766" "will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would"
"5767" "agree with me that he needed it.”"
"5768" ""
"5769" "“I should like to see him very much.”"
"5770" ""
"5771" "“Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your bag.”"
"5772" ""
"5773" "“No, I think that I’ll take it.”"

"5775" "“Very good. Come this way, if you please.” He led us down a passage,"
"5776" "opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a"
"5777" "whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side."
"5778" ""
"5779" "“The third on the right is his,” said the inspector. “Here it is!” He"

"5781" "through."
"5782" ""
"5783" "“He is asleep,” said he. “You can see him very well.”"
"5784" ""
"5785" "We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face"
"5786" "towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was"
"5787" "a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a colored"
"5788" "shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the"
"5789" "inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his"
"5790" "face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an"
"5791" "old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction"
"5792" "had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were"
"5793" "exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low"
"5794" "over his eyes and forehead."
"5795" ""
"5796" "“He’s a beauty, isn’t he?” said the inspector."
"5797" ""
"5798" "“He certainly needs a wash,” remarked Holmes. “I had an idea that he"
"5799" "might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.” He opened"
"5800" "the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very"
"5801" "large bath-sponge."
"5802" ""
"5803" "“He! he! You are a funny one,” chuckled the inspector."
"5804" ""
"5805" "“Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very"
"5806" "quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.”"

"5808" "“Well, I don’t know why not,” said the inspector. “He doesn’t look"
"5809" "a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?” He slipped his key into"
"5810" "the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half"
"5811" "turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes"
"5812" "stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it"
"5813" "twice vigorously across and down the prisoner’s face."
"5814" ""
"5815" "“Let me introduce you,” he shouted, “to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee,"
"5816" "in the county of Kent.”"
"5817" ""
"5818" "Never in my life have I seen such a sight. The man’s face peeled off"
"5819" "under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown"
"5820" "tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and"
"5821" "the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A"
"5822" "twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in"
"5823" "his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and"
"5824" "smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes, and staring about him with sleepy"
"5825" "bewilderment. Then suddenly realizing the exposure, he broke into a"
"5826" "scream, and threw himself down with his face to the pillow."

"5832" "to his destiny. “Be it so,” said he. “And pray, what am I charged with?”"
"5833" ""
"5834" "“With making away with Mr. Neville St.—— Oh, come, you can’t be"
"5835" "charged with that, unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,”"

"5854" "convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against"
"5855" "you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should"
"5856" "find their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure,"
"5857" "make notes upon anything which you might tell us, and submit it to the"

"5864" "“You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was"
"5865" "a school-master in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent"

"5867" "became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor"
"5868" "wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis,"
"5869" "and I volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all"
"5870" "my adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur"
"5871" "that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an"
"5872" "actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had"
"5873" "been famous in the greenroom for my skill. I took advantage now of"
"5874" "my attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as"
"5875" "possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist"
"5876" "by the aid of a small slip of flesh-colored plaster. Then with a red"
"5877" "head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the"
"5878" "busiest part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller, but really as a"
"5879" "beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in"
"5880" "the evening I found, to my surprise, that I had received no less than"
"5881" "26_s._ 4_d._"
"5882" ""
"5883" "“I wrote my articles, and thought little more of the matter until, some"
"5884" "time later, I backed a bill for a friend, and had a writ served upon"
"5885" "me for £25. I was at my wits’ end where to get the money, but a sudden"
"5886" "idea came to me. I begged a fortnight’s grace from the creditor, asked"
"5887" "for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the"
"5888" "city under my disguise. In ten days I had the money, and had paid the"
"5889" "debt."
"5890" ""
"5891" "“Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous"
"5892" "work at £2 a week, when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by"
"5893" "smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and"
"5894" "sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money,"
"5895" "but the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting, and sat day"
"5896" "after day in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my"
"5897" "ghastly face, and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew"
"5898" "my secret. He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in"
"5899" "Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar,"
"5900" "and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about"
"5901" "town. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that"
"5902" "I knew that my secret was safe in his possession."
"5903" ""
"5904" "“Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money."
"5905" "I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn £700"
"5906" "a year—which is less than my average takings—but I had exceptional"
"5907" "advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of"
"5908" "repartee, which improved by practice, and made me quite a recognized"
"5909" "character in the city. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver,"
"5910" "poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take"
"5911" "£2."
"5912" ""
"5913" "“As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country,"
"5914" "and eventually married, without any one having a suspicion as to my"
"5915" "real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the city. She"
"5916" "little knew what."

"5921" "her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms"
"5922" "to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated"
"5923" "him to prevent any one from coming up to me. I heard her voice"
"5924" "down-stairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off"
"5925" "my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and"
"5926" "wig. Even a wife’s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But"
"5927" "then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and"
"5928" "that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening"
"5929" "by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the"
"5930" "bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by"
"5931" "the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag"
"5932" "in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it"
"5933" "disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but"
"5934" "at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few"
"5935" "minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead"
"5936" "of being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his"

"5939" "“I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was"

"5982" "I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning"
"5983" "after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of"
"5984" "the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown,"
"5985" "a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled"
"5986" "morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch"
"5987" "was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy"
"5988" "and disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked"
"5989" "in several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the"
"5990" "chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the"
"5991" "purpose of examination."

"6010" "a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm"
"6011" "of humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to"
"6012" "take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may"
"6013" "be striking and bizarre without being criminal. We have already had"

"6034" "in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting"
"6035" "at this moment in front of Peterson’s fire. The facts are these: about"
"6036" "four o’clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a"
"6037" "very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification, and"
"6038" "was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him"
"6039" "he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger,"
"6040" "and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the"
"6041" "corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a"
"6042" "little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man’s hat, on"
"6043" "which he raised his stick to defend himself, and, swinging it over his"
"6044" "head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward"
"6045" "to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at"
"6046" "having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in"
"6047" "uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and"
"6048" "vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of"
"6049" "Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of"
"6050" "Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and"
"6051" "also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a"
"6052" "most unimpeachable Christmas goose.”"
"6053" ""
"6054" "“Which surely he restored to their owner?”"
"6055" ""
"6056" "“My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that ‘For Mrs."

"6058" "left leg, and it is also true that the initials ‘H. B.’ are legible"
"6059" "upon the lining of this hat; but as there are some thousands of Bakers,"
"6060" "and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy"

"6068" "spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten"
"6069" "without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to"
"6070" "fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the"

"6090" "I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather"
"6091" "ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape,"
"6092" "hard, and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but"
"6093" "was a good deal discolored. There was no maker’s name; but, as Holmes"
"6094" "had remarked, the initials “H. B.” were scrawled upon one side. It was"
"6095" "pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For"
"6096" "the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several"
"6097" "places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the"
"6098" "discolored patches by smearing them with ink."

"6105" "“Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?”"
"6106" ""
"6107" "He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion"
"6108" "which was characteristic of him. “It is perhaps less suggestive than"
"6109" "it might have been,” he remarked, “and yet there are a few inferences"
"6110" "which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a"
"6111" "strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual"
"6112" "is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly"
"6113" "well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon"
"6114" "evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing"
"6115" "to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his"
"6116" "fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at"
"6117" "work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife"
"6118" "has ceased to love him.”"
"6119" ""
"6120" "“My dear Holmes!”"
"6121" ""
"6122" "“He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,” he continued,"
"6123" "disregarding my remonstrance. “He is a man who leads a sedentary"
"6124" "life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged,"
"6125" "has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and"
"6126" "which he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which"
"6127" "are to be deduced from his hat. Also, by-the-way, that it is extremely"
"6128" "improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.”"
"6129" ""
"6130" "“You are certainly joking, Holmes.”"

"6134" ""

"6136" "unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was"
"6137" "intellectual?”"
"6138" ""
"6139" "For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the"
"6140" "forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. “It is a question"
"6141" "of cubic capacity,” said he; “a man with so large a brain must have"
"6142" "something in it.”"
"6143" ""
"6144" "“The decline of his fortunes, then?”"
"6145" ""
"6146" "“This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came"
"6147" "in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of"
"6148" "ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy"
"6149" "so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he"
"6150" "has assuredly gone down in the world.”"
"6151" ""
"6152" "“Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and"
"6153" "the moral retrogression?”"
"6154" ""
"6155" "Sherlock Holmes laughed. “Here is the foresight,” said he, putting"
"6156" "his finger upon the little disk and loop of the hat-securer. “They"
"6157" "are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a"
"6158" "certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this"
"6159" "precaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the"
"6160" "elastic, and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he"
"6161" "has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a"
"6162" "weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavored to conceal some"
"6163" "of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a"
"6164" "sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.”"
"6165" ""
"6166" "“Your reasoning is certainly plausible.”"
"6167" ""
"6168" "“The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled,"
"6169" "that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all"
"6170" "to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the"
"6171" "lining. The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by"
"6172" "the scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there"
"6173" "is a distinct odor of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not"
"6174" "the gritty, gray dust of the street, but the fluffy brown dust of the"
"6175" "house, showing that it has been hung up in-doors most of the time;"
"6176" "while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the"
"6177" "wearer perspired very freely, and could, therefore, hardly be in the"
"6178" "best of training.”"

"6183" "Watson, with a week’s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your"
"6184" "wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also"
"6185" "have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife’s affection.”"

"6266" "bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in"
"6267" "which, as it afterwards transpired, the countess was accustomed to keep"
"6268" "her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly"
"6269" "gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone"
"6270" "could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine"

"6274" "Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who"

"6374" "“Mr. Henry Baker, I believe,” said he, rising from his arm-chair, and"
"6375" "greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so"
"6376" "readily assume. “Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a"
"6377" "cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for"
"6378" "summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right"
"6379" "time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?”"
"6380" ""
"6381" "“Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.”"
"6382" ""
"6383" "He was a large man, with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a"
"6384" "broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled"
"6385" "brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his"
"6386" "extended hand, recalled Holmes’s surmise as to his habits. His rusty"
"6387" "black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned"
"6388" "up, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of"
"6389" "cuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words"
"6390" "with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and"
"6391" "letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune."
"6392" ""
"6393" "“We have retained these things for some days,” said Holmes, “because we"
"6394" "expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at"
"6395" "a loss to know now why you did not advertise.”"
"6396" ""
"6397" "Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. “Shillings have not been"
"6398" "so plentiful with me as they once were,” he remarked. “I had no doubt"
"6399" "that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat"
"6400" "and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt"
"6401" "at recovering them.”"
"6402" ""
"6403" "“Very naturally. By-the-way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat"
"6404" "it.”"
"6405" ""
"6406" "“To eat it!” Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement."
"6407" ""
"6408" "“Yes, it would have been of no use to any one had we not done so. But"
"6409" "I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the"
"6410" "same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?”"
"6411" ""
"6412" "“Oh, certainly, certainly;” answered Mr. Baker, with a sigh of relief."
"6413" ""
"6414" "“Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your"
"6415" "own bird, so if you wish—”"
"6416" ""
"6417" "The man burst into a hearty laugh. “They might be useful to me as"
"6418" "relics of my adventure,” said he, “but beyond that I can hardly see"
"6419" "what use the _disjecta membra_ of my late acquaintance are going to be"
"6420" "to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my"
"6421" "attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.”"
"6422" ""
"6423" "Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his"
"6424" "shoulders."
"6425" ""
"6426" "“There is your hat, then, and there your bird,” said he. “By-the-way,"
"6427" "would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am"
"6428" "somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown"
"6429" "goose.”"
"6430" ""
"6431" "“Certainly, sir,” said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly-gained"
"6432" "property under his arm. “There are a few of us who frequent the ‘Alpha"
"6433" "Inn,’ near the Museum—we are to be found in the Museum itself during"
"6434" "the day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name,"
"6435" "instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence"
"6436" "every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were"
"6437" "duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you,"
"6438" "sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.”"
"6439" "With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and"
"6440" "strode off upon his way."
"6441" ""
"6442" "“So much for Mr. Henry Baker,” said Holmes, when he had closed the door"
"6443" "behind him. “It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about"
"6444" "the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?”"
"6445" ""
"6446" "“Not particularly.”"
"6447" ""
"6448" "“Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper, and follow up"
"6449" "this clew while it is still hot.”"
"6450" ""
"6451" "“By all means.”"
"6452" ""
"6453" "It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats"
"6454" "about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a"
"6455" "cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke"
"6456" "like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly"
"6457" "as we swung through the Doctors’ quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley"
"6458" "Street, and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter"
"6459" "of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the “Alpha Inn,” which is a small"
"6460" "public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into"
"6461" "Holborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar, and ordered"
"6462" "two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord."
"6463" ""
"6464" "“Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,” said he."
"6465" ""
"6466" "“My geese!” The man seemed surprised."
"6467" ""
"6468" "“Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was"
"6469" "a member of your goose club.”"
"6470" ""
"6471" "“Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them’s not _our_ geese.”"
"6472" ""
"6473" "“Indeed! Whose, then?”"
"6474" ""
"6475" "“Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.”"
"6476" ""
"6477" "“Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?”"
"6478" ""
"6479" "“Breckinridge is his name.”"
"6480" ""
"6481" "“Ah! I don’t know him. Well, here’s your good health, landlord, and"
"6482" "prosperity to your house. Good-night?”"
"6483" ""
"6484" "“Now for Mr. Breckinridge,” he continued, buttoning up his coat, as we"
"6485" "came out into the frosty air. “Remember, Watson, that though we have"
"6486" "so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the"
"6487" "other a man who will certainly get seven years’ penal servitude unless"
"6488" "we can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but"
"6489" "confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation"
"6490" "which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has"
"6491" "placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to"
"6492" "the south, then, and quick march!”"
"6493" ""
"6494" "We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag"
"6495" "of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the"
"6496" "name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor, a horsey-looking man,"
"6497" "with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers, was helping a boy to put up"
"6498" "the shutters."
"6499" ""
"6500" "“Good-evening. It’s a cold night,” said Holmes."
"6501" ""
"6502" "The salesman nodded, and shot a questioning glance at my companion."
"6503" ""
"6504" "“Sold out of geese, I see,” continued Holmes, pointing at the bare"
"6505" "slabs of marble."
"6506" ""
"6507" "“Let you have 500 to-morrow morning.”"
"6508" ""
"6509" "“That’s no good.”"
"6510" ""
"6511" "“Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.”"
"6512" ""
"6513" "“Ah, but I was recommended to you.”"
"6514" ""
"6515" "“Who by?”"
"6516" ""
"6517" "“The landlord of the ‘Alpha.’”"
"6518" ""
"6519" "“Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.”"
"6520" ""
"6521" "“Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?”"
"6522" ""
"6523" "To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman."
"6524" ""
"6525" "“Now, then, mister,” said he, with his head cocked and his arms"
"6526" "akimbo, “what are you driving at? Let’s have it straight, now.”"
"6527" ""
"6528" "“It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese"
"6529" "which you supplied to the ‘Alpha.’”"
"6530" ""
"6531" "“Well, then, I sha’n’t tell you. So now!”"
"6532" ""
"6533" "“Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don’t know why you should"
"6534" "be so warm over such a trifle.”"
"6535" ""
"6536" "“Warm! You’d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When"
"6537" "I pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the"
"6538" "business; but it’s ‘Where are the geese?’ and ‘Who did you sell the"
"6539" "geese to?’ and ‘What will you take for the geese?’ One would think they"
"6540" "were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over"
"6541" "them.”"
"6542" ""
"6543" "“Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making"
"6544" "inquiries,” said Holmes, carelessly. “If you won’t tell us the bet is"
"6545" "off, that is all. But I’m always ready to back my opinion on a matter"
"6546" "of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred.”"
"6547" ""
"6548" "“Well, then, you’ve lost your fiver, for it’s town bred,” snapped the"
"6549" "salesman."
"6550" ""
"6551" "“It’s nothing of the kind.”"
"6552" ""
"6553" "“I say it is.”"
"6554" ""
"6555" "“I don’t believe it.”"
"6556" ""
"6557" "“D’you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them"
"6558" "ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the"
"6559" "‘Alpha’ were town bred.”"
"6560" ""
"6561" "“You’ll never persuade me to believe that.”"
"6562" ""
"6563" "“Will you bet, then?”"
"6564" ""
"6565" "“It’s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I’ll"
"6566" "have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.”"
"6567" ""
"6568" "The salesman chuckled grimly. “Bring me the books, Bill,” said he."
"6569" ""
"6570" "The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great"
"6571" "greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp."
"6572" ""
"6573" "“Now then, Mr. Cocksure,” said the salesman, “I thought that I was out"
"6574" "of geese, but before I finish you’ll find that there is still one left"
"6575" "in my shop. You see this little book?”"
"6576" ""
"6577" "“Well?”"
"6578" ""
"6579" "“That’s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D’you see? Well, then,"
"6580" "here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their"
"6581" "names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then!"
"6582" "You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town"
"6583" "suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me.”"
"6584" ""
"6585" "“Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road—249,” read Holmes."
"6586" ""
"6587" "“Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.”"
"6588" ""
"6589" "Holmes turned to the page indicated. “Here you are, ‘Mrs. Oakshott,"
"6590" "117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.’”"
"6591" ""
"6592" "“Now, then, what’s the last entry?”"
"6593" ""
"6594" "“‘December 22. Twenty-four geese at 7_s._ 6_d._’”"
"6595" ""
"6596" "“Quite so. There you are. And underneath?”"
"6597" ""
"6598" "“‘Sold to Mr. Windigate of the ‘Alpha,’ at 12_s._’”"
"6599" ""
"6600" "“What have you to say now?”"
"6601" ""
"6602" "Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his"
"6603" "pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of"
"6604" "a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped"
"6605" "under a lamp-post, and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which"
"6606" "was peculiar to him."
"6607" ""
"6608" "“When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the ‘pink ‘un’"
"6609" "protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,” said"
"6610" "he. “I dare say that if I had put £100 down in front of him, that man"
"6611" "would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from"
"6612" "him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we"
"6613" "are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which"
"6614" "remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs."
"6615" "Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is"
"6616" "clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides"
"6617" "ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should—”"
"6618" ""
"6619" "His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out"
"6620" "from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little"
"6621" "rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light"
"6622" "which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge the salesman,"
"6623" "framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the"
"6624" "cringing figure."
"6625" ""
"6626" "“I’ve had enough of you and your geese,” he shouted. “I wish you were"
"6627" "all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your"
"6628" "silly talk I’ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and"
"6629" "I’ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese"
"6630" "off you?”"
"6631" ""
"6632" "“No; but one of them was mine all the same,” whined the little man."
"6633" ""
"6634" "“Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.”"
"6635" ""
"6636" "“She told me to ask you.”"
"6637" ""
"6638" "“Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I’ve had enough"
"6639" "of it. Get out of this!” He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer"
"6640" "flitted away into the darkness."
"6641" ""
"6642" "“Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,” whispered Holmes. “Come"
"6643" "with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.” Striding"
"6644" "through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring"
"6645" "stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him"
"6646" "upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gaslight"
"6647" "that every vestige of color had been driven from his face."
"6648" ""
"6649" "“Who are you, then? What do you want?” he asked, in a quavering voice."
"6650" ""
"6651" "“You will excuse me,” said Holmes, blandly, “but I could not help"
"6652" "overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I"
"6653" "think that I could be of assistance to you.”"
"6654" ""
"6655" "“You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?”"
"6656" ""
"6657" "“My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other"
"6658" "people don’t know.”"

"6668" "little fellow, with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. “I can"
"6669" "hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.”"
"6670" ""
"6671" "Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. “In that case"
"6672" "we had better discuss it in a cosey room rather than in this windswept"
"6673" "market-place,” said he. “But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it"
"6674" "is that I have the pleasure of assisting.”"
"6675" ""
"6676" "The man hesitated for an instant. “My name is John Robinson,” he"

"6690" "half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he"
"6691" "is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into"
"6692" "the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker"
"6693" "Street. Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin"
"6694" "breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of"
"6695" "his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him."

"6702" ""
"6703" "“Yes, sir.”"
"6704" ""
"6705" "“Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine, in"

"6708" "Ryder quivered with emotion. “Oh, sir,” he cried, “can you tell me"
"6709" "where it went to?”"

"6723" "many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain"
"6724" "whether to claim or to disown it."

"6726" "“The game’s up, Ryder,” said Holmes, quietly. “Hold up, man, or you’ll"

"6728" "got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of"

"6744" "“I see—her ladyship’s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden"
"6745" "wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for"
"6746" "better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means"
"6747" "you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very"
"6748" "pretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had"
"6749" "been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would"
"6750" "rest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some"
"6751" "small job in my lady’s room—you and your confederate Cusack—and you"
"6752" "managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you"

"7158" "has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from—perhaps from the"
"7159" "next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you"
"7160" "whether you had heard it.’"
"7161" ""
"7162" "“‘No, I have not. It must be those wretched gypsies in the plantation.’"
"7163" ""
"7164" "“‘Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did"
"7165" "not hear it also.’"
"7166" ""
"7167" "“‘Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.’"
"7168" ""
"7169" "“‘Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.’ She smiled back at"
"7170" "me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the"
"7171" "lock.”"
"7172" ""
"7173" "“Indeed,” said Holmes. “Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in"
"7174" "at night?”"
"7175" ""
"7176" "“Always.”"
"7177" ""
"7178" "“And why?”"
"7179" ""
"7180" "“I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a"
"7181" "baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.”"
"7182" ""
"7183" "“Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.”"
"7184" ""
"7185" "“I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune"
"7186" "impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you"
"7187" "know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely"
"7188" "allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain"
"7189" "was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the"
"7190" "hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified"
"7191" "woman. I knew that it was my sister’s voice. I sprang from my bed,"
"7192" "wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my"
"7193" "door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a"
"7194" "few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen."
"7195" "As I ran down the passage, my sister’s door was unlocked, and revolved"
"7196" "slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing"
"7197" "what was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I"
"7198" "saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her"
"7199" "hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that"
"7200" "of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that"
"7201" "moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She"
"7202" "writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully"
"7203" "convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognized me, but as I"
"7204" "bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never"
"7205" "forget, ‘Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!’ There"
"7206" "was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with"
"7207" "her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor’s room, but a"
"7208" "fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling"
"7209" "loudly for my step-father, and I met him hastening from his room in his"
"7210" "dressing-gown. When he reached my sister’s side she was unconscious,"
"7211" "and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid"
"7212" "from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and"
"7213" "died without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful"
"7214" "end of my beloved sister.”"
"7215" ""
"7216" "“One moment,” said Holmes; “are you sure about this whistle and"
"7217" "metallic sound? Could you swear to it?”"
"7218" ""
"7219" "“That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my"
"7220" "strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale"
"7221" "and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.”"
"7222" ""
"7223" "“Was your sister dressed?”"
"7224" ""
"7225" "“No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the"
"7226" "charred stump of a match, and in her left a matchbox.”"
"7227" ""
"7228" "“Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the"
"7229" "alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the"
"7230" "coroner come to?”"
"7231" ""
"7232" "“He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott’s conduct"
"7233" "had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any"
"7234" "satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had"
"7235" "been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by"
"7236" "old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every"
"7237" "night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite"
"7238" "solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with"
"7239" "the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large"
"7240" "staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when"
"7241" "she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her.”"
"7242" ""
"7243" "“How about poison?”"
"7244" ""
"7245" "“The doctors examined her for it, but without success.”"
"7246" ""
"7247" "“What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?”"
"7248" ""
"7249" "“It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though"
"7250" "what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.”"
"7251" ""
"7252" "“Were there gypsies in the plantation at the time?”"
"7253" ""
"7254" "“Yes, there are nearly always some there.”"
"7255" ""
"7256" "“Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band—a speckled"
"7257" "band?”"
"7258" ""
"7259" "“Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium,"
"7260" "sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to"
"7261" "these very gypsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted"
"7262" "handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have"
"7263" "suggested the strange adjective which she used.”"
"7264" ""
"7265" "Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied."
"7266" ""
"7267" "“These are very deep waters,” said he; “pray go on with your narrative.”"
"7268" ""
"7269" "“Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately"
"7270" "lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have"
"7271" "known for many years, has done me the honor to ask my hand in marriage."
"7272" "His name is Armitage—Percy Armitage—the second son of Mr. Armitage,"
"7273" "of Crane Water, near Reading. My step-father has offered no opposition"
"7274" "to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two"
"7275" "days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building,"
"7276" "and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into"
"7277" "the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in"
"7278" "which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night,"
"7279" "as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in"
"7280" "the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of"
"7281" "her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be"
"7282" "seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I"
"7283" "dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart"
"7284" "at the ‘Crown Inn,’ which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from"
"7285" "whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you"
"7286" "and asking your advice.”"
"7287" ""
"7288" "“You have done wisely,” said my friend. “But have you told me all?”"
"7289" ""

"7293" ""
"7294" "“Why, what do you mean?”"
"7295" ""
"7296" "For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the"
"7297" "hand that lay upon our visitor’s knee. Five little livid spots, the"
"7298" "marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist."
"7299" ""
"7300" "“You have been cruelly used,” said Holmes."
"7301" ""
"7302" "The lady colored deeply and covered over her injured wrist. “He is a"
"7303" "hard man,” she said, “and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.”"
"7304" ""
"7305" "There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his"
"7306" "hands and stared into the crackling fire."
"7307" ""
"7308" "“This is a very deep business,” he said, at last. “There are a thousand"
"7309" "details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course"
"7310" "of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to"
"7311" "Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms"
"7312" "without the knowledge of your step-father?”"
"7313" ""
"7314" "“As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most"
"7315" "important business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and"
"7316" "that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a house-keeper"
"7317" "now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the"
"7318" "way.”"
"7319" ""
"7320" "“Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?”"
"7321" ""
"7322" "“By no means.”"
"7323" ""
"7324" "“Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?”"
"7325" ""
"7326" "“I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in"

"7328" "in time for your coming.”"
"7329" ""
"7330" "“And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small"
"7331" "business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?”"

"7333" "“No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided"
"7334" "my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this"
"7335" "afternoon.” She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided"
"7336" "from the room."

"7339" "leaning back in his chair."

"7342" ""
"7343" "“Dark enough and sinister enough.”"
"7344" ""
"7345" "“Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are"
"7346" "sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her"
"7347" "sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious"
"7348" "end.”"

"7350" "“What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very"
"7351" "peculiar words of the dying woman?”"

"7355" "“When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a"
"7356" "band of gypsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the"
"7357" "fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an"
"7358" "interest in preventing his step-daughter’s marriage, the dying allusion"
"7359" "to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a"
"7360" "metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars"
"7361" "which secured the shutters falling back into their place, I think that"
"7362" "there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along"
"7363" "those lines.”"
"7364" ""
"7365" "“But what, then, did the gypsies do?”"
"7366" ""
"7367" "“I cannot imagine.”"
"7368" ""
"7369" "“I see many objections to any such theory.”"
"7370" ""
"7371" "“And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to"
"7372" "Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal,"
"7373" "or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!”"
"7374" ""
"7375" "The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our"
"7376" "door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed"
"7377" "himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the"
"7378" "professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long"
"7379" "frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in"
"7380" "his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar"
"7381" "of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to"
"7382" "side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with"
"7383" "the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the"
"7384" "other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,"
"7385" "fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird"
"7386" "of prey."

"7388" "“Which of you is Holmes?” asked this apparition."

"7390" "“My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,” said my companion,"
"7391" "quietly."

"7393" "“I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.”"
"7394" ""
"7395" "“Indeed, doctor,” said Holmes, blandly. “Pray take a seat.”"

"7405" "companion, imperturbably."
"7406" ""
"7407" "“Ha! You put me off, do you?” said our new visitor, taking a step"
"7408" "forward and shaking his hunting-crop. “I know you, you scoundrel! I"
"7409" "have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.”"
"7410" ""
"7411" "My friend smiled."
"7412" ""
"7413" "“Holmes, the busybody!”"

"7417" "“Holmes, the Scotland-yard Jack-in-office!”"

"7425" "dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.” He stepped swiftly forward,"
"7426" "seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands."
"7427" ""
"7428" "“See that you keep yourself out of my grip,” he snarled, and hurling"

"7432" "quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my"
"7433" "grip was not much more feeble than his own.” As he spoke he picked up"
"7434" "the steel poker, and with a sudden effort straightened it out again."
"7435" ""
"7436" "“Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official"
"7437" "detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,"
"7438" "however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from"
"7439" "her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson,"
"7440" "we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors’"

"7449" ""
"7450" "“I have seen the will of the deceased wife,” said he. “To determine"
"7451" "its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices"
"7452" "of the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which"
"7453" "at the time of the wife’s death was little short of £1100, is now,"
"7454" "through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than £750. Each"
"7455" "daughter can claim an income of £250, in case of marriage. It is"
"7456" "evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would"
"7457" "have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to"
"7458" "a very serious extent. My morning’s work has not been wasted, since it"
"7459" "has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the"
"7460" "way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for"
"7461" "dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting"
"7462" "ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and"
"7463" "drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your"
"7464" "revolver into your pocket. An Eley’s No. 2 is an excellent argument"
"7465" "with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a"
"7466" "tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.”"

"7468" "At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead,"
"7469" "where we hired a trap at the station inn, and drove for four or five"

"7471" "a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and"
"7472" "way-side hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and"
"7473" "the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at"
"7474" "least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the"
"7475" "spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion"
"7476" "sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over"
"7477" "his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest"
"7478" "thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and"

"7496" "some distance to the left; “but if you want to get to the house, you’ll"

"7498" "the fields. There it is, where the lady is walking.”"
"7499" ""

"7539" "the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the"
"7540" "windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that"

"7565" "“As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable"
"7566" "from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room"
"7567" "and bar your shutters.”"
"7568" ""
"7569" "Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through"
"7570" "the open window, endeavored in every way to force the shutter open,"
"7571" "but without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be"
"7572" "passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but"
"7573" "they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. “Hum!”"
"7574" "said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity; “my theory certainly"
"7575" "presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they"
"7576" "were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the"
"7577" "matter.”"
"7578" ""
"7579" "A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the"
"7580" "three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber,"
"7581" "so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now"
"7582" "sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a"
"7583" "homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after"
"7584" "the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood"
"7585" "in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a"
"7586" "dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles,"
"7587" "with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the"
"7588" "room, save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards"
"7589" "round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so"
"7590" "old and discolored that it may have dated from the original building of"
"7591" "the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent,"
"7592" "while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in"
"7593" "every detail of the apartment."
"7594" ""
"7595" "“Where does that bell communicate with?” he asked, at last, pointing to"
"7596" "a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually"
"7597" "lying upon the pillow."
"7598" ""
"7599" "“It goes to the house-keeper’s room.”"
"7600" ""
"7601" "“It looks newer than the other things?”"
"7602" ""
"7603" "“Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.”"
"7604" ""
"7605" "“Your sister asked for it, I suppose?”"
"7606" ""
"7607" "“No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we"
"7608" "wanted for ourselves.”"
"7609" ""
"7610" "“Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You"
"7611" "will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this"
"7612" "floor.” He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand,"
"7613" "and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks"
"7614" "between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which"
"7615" "the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed, and spent"
"7616" "some time in staring at it, and in running his eye up and down the"
"7617" "wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug."
"7618" ""
"7619" "“Why, it’s a dummy,” said he."
"7620" ""
"7621" "“Won’t it ring?”"
"7622" ""
"7623" "“No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You"
"7624" "can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little"
"7625" "opening for the ventilator is.”"
"7626" ""
"7627" "“How very absurd! I never noticed that before.”"
"7628" ""
"7629" "“Very strange!” muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. “There are one or"
"7630" "two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a"
"7631" "builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the"
"7632" "same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!”"
"7633" ""
"7634" "“That is also quite modern,” said the lady."
"7635" ""
"7636" "“Done about the same time as the bell-rope?” remarked Holmes."
"7637" ""
"7638" "“Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.”"
"7639" ""
"7640" "“They seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummy"
"7641" "bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your"

"7643" "inner apartment.”"
"7644" ""
"7645" "Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s chamber was larger than that of his"
"7646" "step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden"
"7647" "shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an arm-chair"
"7648" "beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table,"
"7649" "and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye."
"7650" "Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the"
"7651" "keenest interest."

"7662" ""
"7663" "“No. What a strange idea!”"
"7664" ""

"7669" ""
"7670" "“Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a"
"7671" "saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I dare"
"7672" "say. There is one point which I should wish to determine.” He squatted"
"7673" "down in front of the wooden chair, and examined the seat of it with the"
"7674" "greatest attention."
"7675" ""
"7676" "“Thank you. That is quite settled,” said he, rising and putting his"
"7677" "lens in his pocket. “Hello! Here is something interesting!”"
"7678" ""
"7679" "The object which had caught his eye was a small dog-lash hung on one"
"7680" "corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself, and tied"
"7681" "so as to make a loop of whip-cord."
"7682" ""
"7683" "“What do you make of that, Watson?”"
"7684" ""
"7685" "“It’s a common enough lash. But I don’t know why it should be tied.”"

"7687" "“That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it’s a wicked world,"
"7688" "and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of"

"7690" "permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.”"
"7691" ""
"7692" "I had never seen my friend’s face so grim or his brow so dark as it"
"7693" "was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked"
"7694" "several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself"

"7904" "tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray"

"7906" "occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long"
"7907" "drawn cat-like whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at"
"7908" "liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock,"

"7910" "quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat"

"7988" "care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official"

"7990" "indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet"

"7992" "back next day."

"7994" "“I had,” said he, “come to an entirely erroneous conclusion, which"
"7995" "shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from"
"7996" "insufficient data. The presence of the gypsies, and the use of the"
"7997" "word ‘band,’ which was used by the poor girl, no doubt to explain the"
"7998" "appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of"
"7999" "her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I"
"8000" "can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position"
"8001" "when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened"
"8002" "an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the"
"8003" "door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to"
"8004" "you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the"
"8005" "bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped"
"8006" "to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was"
"8007" "there as bridge for something passing through the hole, and coming"
"8008" "to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when"
"8009" "I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a"
"8010" "supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right"
"8011" "track. The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be"
"8012" "discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a"
"8013" "clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity"
"8014" "with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point"
"8015" "of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who"
"8016" "could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where"
"8017" "the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of"
"8018" "course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to"
"8019" "the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which"
"8020" "we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this"
"8021" "ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it"
"8022" "would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not"
"8023" "bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but"
"8024" "sooner or later she must fall a victim."

"8028" "standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he"
"8029" "should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk,"
"8030" "and the loop of whip-cord were enough to finally dispel any doubts"
"8031" "which may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was"
"8032" "obviously caused by her step-father hastily closing the door of his"
"8033" "safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know"
"8034" "the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I"
"8035" "heard the creature hiss, as I have no doubt that you did also, and I"

"8760" "just a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my"

"8768" "him whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was"
"8769" "strange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for"

"8863" "“Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,” observed Bradstreet,"

"8865" "gang.”"
"8866" ""
"8867" "“None at all,” said Holmes. “They are coiners on a large scale, and"

"8871" "“We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,” said the"

"8880" "saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small"
"8881" "clump of trees in the neighborhood, and hung like an immense ostrich"
"8882" "feather over the landscape."

"8902" "Englishman, and there isn’t a man in the parish who has a better-lined"
"8903" "waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as"
"8904" "I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good"
"8905" "Berkshire beef would do him no harm.”"
"8906" ""
"8907" "The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all"
"8908" "hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill,"
"8909" "and there was a great wide-spread whitewashed building in front of us,"
"8910" "spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front"
"8911" "three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under."
"8912" ""
"8913" "“That’s it!” cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. “There is the"
"8914" "gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second"
"8915" "window is the one that I jumped from.”"
"8916" ""
"8917" "“Well, at least,” said Holmes, “you have had your revenge upon them."
"8918" "There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was"
"8919" "crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt"
"8920" "they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time."

"8925" "word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister"
"8926" "German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met"
"8927" "a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving"
"8928" "rapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the"
"8929" "fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes’s ingenuity failed ever to"
"8930" "discover the least clew as to their whereabouts."

"8932" "The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which"
"8933" "they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed"
"8934" "human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset,"
"8935" "however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the"
"8936" "flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been"
"8937" "reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and"
"8938" "iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our"
"8939" "unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin"
"8940" "were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found,"
"8941" "which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have"

"8944" "How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the"
"8945" "spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a"

"8947" "tale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom"
"8948" "had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the"
"8949" "whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold"

"8953" "“Well,” said our engineer ruefully, as we took our seats to return once"
"8954" "more to London, “it has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my"

"9153" "rumors which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of"
"9154" "the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public"
"9155" "attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served"

"9161" "Lord Eustace, and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister"

"9163" "proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster"
"9164" "Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little"
"9165" "trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained,"
"9166" "who endeavored to force her way into the house after the bridal party,"
"9167" "alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after"
"9168" "a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and"
"9169" "the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before"
"9170" "this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest,"
"9171" "when she complained of a sudden indisposition, and retired to her room."
"9172" "Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed"
"9173" "her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber"
"9174" "for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to"
"9175" "the passage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave"
"9176" "the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his"
"9177" "mistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that"
"9178" "his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with"
"9179" "the bridegroom, instantly put themselves into communication with"
"9180" "the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will"
"9181" "probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business."
"9182" "Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to"
"9183" "the whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumors of foul play in"
"9184" "the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of"
"9185" "the woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that,"

"9211" "with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had"
"9212" "ever been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet"
"9213" "his general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a"
"9214" "slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His"
"9215" "hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled"
"9216" "round the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful"
"9217" "to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white"
"9218" "waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-colored"
"9219" "gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left"

"9295" "camp, and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education"
"9296" "has come from Nature rather than from the school-master. She is what"
"9297" "we call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free,"
"9298" "unfettered by any sort of traditions. She is impetuous—volcanic, I"
"9299" "was about to say. She is swift in making up her mind, and fearless"
"9300" "in carrying out her resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have"
"9301" "given her the name which I have the honor to bear”—he gave a little"
"9302" "stately cough—“had not I thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I"

"9402" ""
"9403" "“On your arm?”"

"9407" "muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came back.”"
"9408" ""
"9409" "“But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her"

"9412" ""
"9413" "“Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in"

"9423" "her ungenerously, and she has no just cause of complaint against me;"
"9424" "but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing,"
"9425" "but exceedingly hot-headed, and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me"
"9426" "dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married; and, to"
"9427" "tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly"
"9428" "was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came"
"9429" "to Mr. Doran’s door just after we returned, and she endeavored to push"
"9430" "her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even"
"9431" "threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the"
"9432" "sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon"
"9433" "pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good"

"9748" "poorer was Frank; so at last pa wouldn’t hear of our engagement lasting"
"9749" "any longer, and he took me away to ’Frisco. Frank wouldn’t throw up"
"9750" "his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without pa"
"9751" "knowing anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so"
"9752" "we just fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and"
"9753" "make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as"
"9754" "much as pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time, and"
"9755" "pledged myself not to marry any one else while he lived. ‘Why shouldn’t"
"9756" "we be married right away, then,’ said he, ‘and then I will feel sure of"
"9757" "you; and I won’t claim to be your husband until I come back?’ Well, we"
"9758" "talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman"
"9759" "all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank"
"9760" "went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to pa."
"9761" ""
"9762" "“The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went"
"9763" "prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After"
"9764" "that came a long newspaper story about how a miners’ camp had been"
"9765" "attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank’s name among the"
"9766" "killed. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa"
"9767" "thought I had a decline, and took me to half the doctors in ’Frisco."
"9768" "Not a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted"
"9769" "that Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to ’Frisco, and we"

"9773" ""
"9774" "“Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I’d have done my"

"9778" "as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing"
"9779" "and looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at"
"9780" "first; but when I looked again, there he was still, with a kind of"
"9781" "question in his eyes as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to"
"9782" "see him. I wonder I didn’t drop. I know that everything was turning"
"9783" "round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee"
"9784" "in my ear. I didn’t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make"
"9785" "a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know"
"9786" "what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to"
"9787" "be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that"
"9788" "he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped"
"9789" "my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he"
"9790" "returned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when"
"9791" "he made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment"

"9798" "to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all"

"9800" "afterwards. I hadn’t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank"
"9801" "out of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me, and"

"9807" "away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that"

"9819" "a line to pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful"
"9820" "to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that"
"9821" "breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my"
"9822" "wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that I should"
"9823" "not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find"

"10328" "sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to"
"10329" "charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private"
"10330" "matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was"
"10331" "national property. I was determined that the law should have its way in"
"10332" "everything."
"10333" ""
"10334" "“‘At least,’ said he, ‘you will not have me arrested at once. It would"

"10336" "five minutes.’"
"10337" ""
"10338" "“‘That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have"
"10339" "stolen,’ said I. And then realizing the dreadful position in which I"
"10340" "was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honor, but that"
"10341" "of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened"
"10342" "to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it"
"10343" "all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing"
"10344" "stones."
"10345" ""
"10346" "“‘You may as well face the matter,’ said I; ‘you have been caught in"
"10347" "the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you"
"10348" "but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the"
"10349" "beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.’"
"10350" ""
"10351" "“‘Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,’ he answered, turning"
"10352" "away from me, with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any"
"10353" "words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called"
"10354" "in the inspector, and gave him into custody. A search was made at once,"
"10355" "not only of his person, but of his room, and of every portion of the"
"10356" "house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of"
"10357" "them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all"
"10358" "our persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell,"
"10359" "and I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried"
"10360" "round to you, to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the"
"10361" "matter. The police have openly confessed that they can at present make"
"10362" "nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I"
"10363" "have already offered a reward of £1000. My God, what shall I do! I have"
"10364" "lost my honor, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!”"
"10365" ""

"10408" ""
"10409" "“Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His"
"10410" "silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular"
"10411" "points about the case. What did the police think of the noise which"
"10412" "awoke you from your sleep?”"

"10431" "police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a"
"10432" "simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is"
"10433" "involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his"
"10434" "bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau,"
"10435" "took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of"
"10436" "it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the"
"10437" "thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then"
"10438" "returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed"
"10439" "himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is"
"10440" "such a theory tenable?”"

"10449" "My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition,"
"10450" "which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were"
"10451" "deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that"
"10452" "the guilt of the banker’s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it"
"10453" "did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes’s"
"10454" "judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long"
"10455" "as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke"
"10456" "a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin"
"10457" "upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest"
"10458" "thought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little"
"10459" "glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into"
"10460" "a desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway"
"10461" "journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence"
"10462" "of the great financier."
"10463" ""
"10464" "Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back"
"10465" "a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad"
"10466" "lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the"
"10467" "entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into"
"10468" "a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the"
"10469" "kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen’s entrance. On the left ran a"
"10470" "lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds"
"10471" "at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left"
"10472" "us standing at the door, and walked slowly all round the house, across"
"10473" "the front, down the tradesmen’s path, and so round by the garden behind"
"10474" "into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into"
"10475" "the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were"
"10476" "sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in."
"10477" "She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes,"
"10478" "which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do"
"10479" "not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman’s face."
"10480" "Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying."
"10481" "As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater"
"10482" "sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the"
"10483" "more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character,"
"10484" "with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence,"
"10485" "she went straight to her uncle, and passed her hand over his head with"
"10486" "a sweet womanly caress."
"10487" ""
"10488" "“You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not,"
"10489" "dad?” she asked."

"10491" "“No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.”"

"10505" "“Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh do, do take my word"

"10507" "so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!”"
"10508" ""
"10509" "“I shall never let it drop until the gems are found—never, Mary! Your"

"10558" "“Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl,"

"10585" "He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the"
"10586" "large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he"

"10608" "upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller’s art,"
"10609" "and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one"
"10610" "side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three"
"10611" "gems had been torn away."
"10612" ""
"10613" "“Now, Mr. Holder,” said Holmes, “here is the corner which corresponds"
"10614" "to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will"

"10621" "exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to"
"10622" "break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would"
"10623" "happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a"

"10680" "yet three when we found ourselves in our room once more. He hurried to"

"11829" "“I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I"

"11831" "found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you,"
"11832" "Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was"
"11833" "frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants,"
"11834" "even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring"
"11835" "you down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house,"
"11836" "but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon"
"11837" "made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down"
"11838" "to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then"
"11839" "returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind"
"11840" "as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered"
"11841" "that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that"
"11842" "evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had"
"11843" "any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him"
"11844" "free. I slipped in in safety, and lay awake half the night in my joy at"
"11845" "the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come"
"11846" "into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o’clock,"
"11847" "for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all"
"11848" "the evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you"
"11849" "all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could"
"11850" "tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.”"
"11851" ""
"11852" "Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My"
"11853" "friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his"
"11854" "pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face."
"11855" ""
"11856" "“Is Toller still drunk?” he asked."
"11857" ""
"11858" "“Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing"
"11859" "with him.”"
"11860" ""
"11861" "“That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?”"
"11862" ""
"11863" "“Yes.”"
"11864" ""
"11865" "“Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?”"
"11866" ""
"11867" "“Yes, the wine-cellar.”"
"11868" ""
"11869" "“You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave"
"11870" "and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one"
"11871" "more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite"
"11872" "exceptional woman.”"
"11873" ""
"11874" "“I will try. What is it?”"
"11875" ""
"11876" "“We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o’clock, my friend and I."
"11877" "The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be"
"11878" "incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If"
"11879" "you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the"
"11880" "key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.”"
"11881" ""
"11882" "“I will do it.”"
"11883" ""
"11884" "“Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course"
"11885" "there is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to"
"11886" "personate some one, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber."
"11887" "That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is"
"11888" "the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said"
"11889" "to have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her"
"11890" "in height, figure, and the color of your hair. Hers had been cut off,"
"11891" "very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of"
"11892" "course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came"
"11893" "upon her tresses. The man in the road was, undoubtedly, some friend of"
"11894" "hers—possibly her _fiancé_—and no doubt, as you wore the girl’s dress"
"11895" "and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever"
"11896" "he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was"
"11897" "perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog"
"11898" "is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavoring to communicate"
"11899" "with her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case"
"11900" "is the disposition of the child.”"
"11901" ""
"11902" "“What on earth has that to do with it?” I ejaculated."
"11903" ""
"11904" "“My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as"
"11905" "to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don’t you see"
"11906" "that the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first"
"11907" "real insight into the character of parents by studying their children."
"11908" "This child’s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty’s"
"11909" "sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should"
"11910" "suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in"
"11911" "their power.”"
"11912" ""
"11913" "“I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,” cried our client. “A"
"11914" "thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have"
"11915" "hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor"
"11916" "creature.”"
"11917" ""
"11918" "“We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We"
"11919" "can do nothing until seven o’clock. At that hour we shall be with you,"
"11920" "and it will not be long before we solve the mystery.”"
"11921" ""
"11922" "We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the"
"11923" "Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a way-side public-house. The"
"11924" "group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in"
"11925" "the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even"
"11926" "had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step."
"11927" ""
"11928" "“Have you managed it?” asked Holmes."
"11929" ""
"11930" "A loud thudding noise came from somewhere down-stairs. “That is"
"11931" "Mrs. Toller in the cellar,” said she. “Her husband lies snoring on"
"11932" "the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr."
"11933" "Rucastle’s.”"
"11934" ""
"11935" "“You have done well indeed!” cried Holmes, with enthusiasm. “Now lead"
"11936" "the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.”"
"11937" ""
"11938" "We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage,"
"11939" "and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had"
"11940" "described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he"
"11941" "tried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came"
"11942" "from within, and at the silence Holmes’s face clouded over."
"11943" ""
"11944" "“I trust that we are not too late,” said he. “I think, Miss Hunter,"
"11945" "that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to"
"11946" "it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.”"
"11947" ""
"11948" "It was an old rickety door, and gave at once before our united"
"11949" "strength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no"
"11950" "furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of"
"11951" "linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone."
"11952" ""
"11953" "“There has been some villainy here,” said Holmes; “this beauty has"

"11955" ""
"11956" "“But how?”"
"11957" ""
"11958" "“Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.” He swung"
"11959" "himself up onto the roof. “Ah, yes,” he cried; “here’s the end of a"
"11960" "long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it.”"
"11961" ""
"11962" "“But it is impossible,” said Miss Hunter; “the ladder was not there"
"11963" "when the Rucastles went away.”"
"11964" ""
"11965" "“He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and"
"11966" "dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he"
"11967" "whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be"
"11968" "as well for you to have your pistol ready.”"
"11969" ""
"11970" "The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the"
"11971" "door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his"
"11972" "hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of"
"11973" "him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him."
"11974" ""
"11975" "“You villain!” said he, “where’s your daughter?”"
"11976" ""
"11977" "The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight."
"11978" ""
"11979" "“It is for me to ask you that,” he shrieked, “you thieves! Spies and"
"11980" "thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I’ll serve"
"11981" "you!” He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go."

"11985" "“I have my revolver,” said I."
"11986" ""
"11987" "“Better close the front door,” cried Holmes, and we all rushed down"
"11988" "the stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the"
"11989" "baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying"
"11990" "sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red"
"11991" "face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door."
"11992" ""
"11993" "“My God!” he cried. “Some one has loosed the dog. It’s not been fed for"
"11994" "two days. Quick, quick, or it’ll be too late!”"
"11995" ""
"11996" "Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller"
"11997" "hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle"
"11998" "buried in Rucastle’s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the"
"11999" "ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its"
"12000" "keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. With"
"12001" "much labor we separated them, and carried him, living but horribly"
"12002" "mangled, into the house. We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and,"
"12003" "having despatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I"
"12004" "did what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him"
"12005" "when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room."
"12006" ""
"12007" "“Mrs. Toller!” cried Miss Hunter."
"12008" ""
"12009" "“Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went"
"12010" "up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn’t let me know what you were"
"12011" "planning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.”"
"12012" ""
"12013" "“Ha!” said Holmes, looking keenly at her. “It is clear that Mrs. Toller"
"12014" "knows more about this matter than any one else.”"
"12015" ""
"12016" "“Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.”"
"12017" ""
"12018" "“Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it, for there are several points"
"12019" "on which I must confess that I am still in the dark.”"
"12020" ""
"12021" "“I will soon make it clear to you,” said she; “and I’d have done"
"12022" "so before now if I could ha’ got out from the cellar. If there’s"
"12023" "police-court business over this, you’ll remember that I was the one"
"12024" "that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice’s friend too."
"12025" ""
"12026" "“She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn’t, from the time that"
"12027" "her father married again. She was slighted like, and had no say in"
"12028" "anything; but it never really became bad for her until after she met"
"12029" "Mr. Fowler at a friend’s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice"
"12030" "had rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she"
"12031" "was, that she never said a word about them, but just left everything in"
"12032" "Mr. Rucastle’s hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was"
"12033" "a chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the"
"12034" "law would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on"
"12035" "it. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not,"
"12036" "he could use her money. When she wouldn’t do it, he kept on worrying"
"12037" "her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death’s door."
"12038" "Then she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her"
"12039" "beautiful hair cut off; but that didn’t make no change in her young"
"12040" "man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.”"
"12041" ""
"12042" "“Ah,” said Holmes, “I think that what you have been good enough to"
"12043" "tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all"
"12044" "that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of"
"12045" "imprisonment?”"
"12046" ""
"12047" "“Yes, sir.”"
"12048" ""
"12049" "“And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the"
"12050" "disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.”"
"12051" ""
"12052" "“That was it, sir.”"
"12053" ""
"12054" "“But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should"
"12055" "be, blockaded the house, and, having met you, succeeded by certain"
"12056" "arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests"
"12057" "were the same as his.”"
"12058" ""
"12059" "“Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,” said Mrs."
"12060" "Toller, serenely."
"12061" ""
"12062" "“And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of"
"12063" "drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master"
"12064" "had gone out.”"
"12065" ""
"12066" "“You have it, sir, just as it happened.”"
"12067" ""
"12068" "“I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,” said Holmes, “for you"
"12069" "have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes"
"12070" "the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had"
"12071" "best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our"
"12072" "_locus standi_ now is rather a questionable one.”"
"12073" ""
"12074" "And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper"
"12075" "beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a"
"12076" "broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife."
"12077" "They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of"
"12078" "Rucastle’s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them."
"12079" "Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in"
"12080" "Southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a"
"12081" "Government appointment in the Island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet"
"12082" "Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no"
"12083" "further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of"
"12084" "one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at"
